```
### Additional Feature
```
I have developed a single-page application (SPA) with a focus on clean and efficient form handling using the Formik library. The application seamlessly manages user registration and login functionalities through well-organized forms, adhering to the single responsibility principle. This design approach ensures clarity and maintainability by assigning distinct responsibilities to components, creating a smooth and user-friendly experience for both creating and updating tasks. The application's structure is geared towards providing a cohesive and aesthetically pleasing interface, enhancing the overall user experience in a single, unified environment.
```
### Things i have not done
```
While developing the application, I have currently focused on creating a seamless user experience for user registration, login, and task management. However, I would like to highlight that logout functionality and additional routing features, such as redirects, have not been implemented at this stage. These aspects can be incorporated in future iterations to enhance the overall functionality and navigation of the application.
